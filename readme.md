# pose_detection

Save 2 poses using 'R' and 'S' keys. A pose takes 2 seconds to save so that you can click the keyboard and then go to your pose.

This app keeps track of how many times you switch from the S position to the R position. For example, if you are counting push ups you can set the R as the relaxed position and S as the contracted position.

You can click the 'X' key to reset the counter. You can also change the 'R' and 'S' keys as many times as you'd like.
